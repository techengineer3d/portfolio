### Overview

I worked on improving the graphics engine for the Playstation 3 title "Last Rebellion".

&nbsp;

### Graphics Engine Development

#### [Shader System](https://www.studiolibrary.com/){: target="_blank"}

Initially the graphics engine was in early alpha and only capable of simple shading.

I worked on making the rendering system more advanced so that it would be capable of supporting more advanced shaders and post effects.

I created shaders for dynamic lighting, toon shading effects and normal mapping.

As a part of internal research and development work, I also created toon outline and painterly style post effects.

I also tried implementing animation "skinning" on the Playstation 3's SPU processors, which was challenging.
