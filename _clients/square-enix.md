# Square Enix Japan
2021/06 ~ 2024/06 <br/>
Tools & Workflow Engineer <br/>
Advanced Technology Department <br/>
Tokyo, Japan <br/>

## Overview
At [Square Enix Japan](https://www.square-enix.com/), I worked as a Tools & Workflow engineer in the [Advanced Technology Division](http://www.jp.square-enix.com/tech/#), developing in-house Maya tools as well as game engine editor tools for Luminous Engine and Unreal Engine 5.

### Maya Facial Animation Exporter
I was assigned to work on the company’s internal facial animation tools and programming libraries. <br/>
I added several new features to the internal Maya facial animation export tool. <br/>
I implemented a tool data compatibility feature so that the tool would still work with Maya scenes that had been saved with facial animation data from a different version of the tool. <br/>
This step made sure that artists could continue their work without interruption due to different tool data versions. <br/>

I added support for selective export of facial animation data, such as facial motion, facial libraries and catalogs, and character rig data. <br/>
This allowed the artists to export only the data they needed, and helped to reduce data export times. <br/>
I also wrote the tool’s user manual in Japanese and English language using [Material for MK Docs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). <br/>

### Facial Animation Debug Tools For Luminous Engine And Unreal Engine
I created debugging tools for testing character facial rig controls in Luminous Engine and Unreal Engine. <br/>
I created a panel that displayed a list of all the rig controls, which could be filtered in real time by control name, or by the control type. <br/>
The tool featured slider UI for both single and triple channel (.x .y .z) rig controls, allowing the user to test any control movement. <br/>
I also created an animation playback tool for testing the facial motions in the game engine editor. <br/>
The playback tool featured standard media controls such as play, pause, stop, frame advance and also a timeline slider. <br/>

### Internal Maya Tools Python Upgrade Work
I assisted in upgrading internal Maya tool source code from Python 2 to Python 3 in order to support newer versions of Maya. <br/>
This ensured that the artists could continue their work with the latest version of Maya, using the latest features. <br/>

### Game Development Work
I volunteered to work on a GPS based mobile game project that required additional engineers. <br/>
The game featured a procedural building generation system that dynamically created buildings from model parts. <br/>
I added support to load regular pre-built 3d building models, and also added a UI switch to the game to toggle between the display of procedural and pre-built models. <br/>
