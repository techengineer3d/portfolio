### Overview

I worked on tools programming and art pipeline improvement for the Playstation 3 title "Demon's Souls".

&nbsp;

### Tools Development

#### AlienBrain

AlienBrain is a management and version control system for 2D and 3D art assets. The team working on the Demon's Souls project had many custom created assets they wanted to add to AlienBrain.

I created plugins to extend the kinds of assets AlienBrain manages and added support for custom in-house material and shader files.

#### Art Pipeline Improvement

One of the biggest issues on the art creation side was that it took too long for the artists to check the look of the 3d model assets "in-game" on the Playstation 3.

The process of turning 3d art assets into game assets and loading it up on the game console took a very long time.

After doing information research on several tools and middleware, I suggested using tools from [Gamebryo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamebryo){: target="_blank"}. This provided the art team with a way to preview changes made to their 3D art assets on the Playstation 3 much more quickly.
