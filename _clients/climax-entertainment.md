### Overview

I worked on the creation of a programming framework for the Nintendo DS title &nbsp;&nbsp; "Steal Princess".

### Framework Development

#### DS Graphics and Memory Management

Programming for the DS can be difficult. It has 2 screens and also has 2D and 3D modes. Memory management of graphics is different depending what mode your using. To make the DS easier to program for, I created a library that handled the loading, display and management of memory for 2D and 3D assets.

I was inspired by the Microsoft XNA framework which was created to simplify the programming of games on Microsoft platforms. The XNA framework made it really easy to load and display 2D and 3D assets. So, I made a small version for the DS.
