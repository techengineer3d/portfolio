# Monolith Soft

## Employment Overview

From February 1st 2006 to January 28th 2007 I worked as a **Physics Programmer** at [Monolith Software](https://www.monolithsoft.co.jp/){: target="_blank"} in Meguro, Tokyo.

I was contracted out to Monolith Soft from a game development staffing company.

### Overview

I worked on vehicle physics for the Nintendo Wii title "Disaster: Day of Crisis".

The [Havok Physics](https://www.havok.com/products/havok-physics/){: target="_blank"} engine was used for the physics in the game.

### Physics Development

#### [Vehicle Physics](https://www.studiolibrary.com/){: target="_blank"}

Havok Vehicle Physics is a part of the Havok Physics game middleware. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; It provides programmers with a way to simulate realistic vehicle physics.

I was part of a small group (3 people) and helped implement the vehicle physics for the cars and trucks in the game.

I started by trying out the samples in the Havok SDK (C++) and changing the various vehicle settings to see how it affected the car physics.

Then I&nbsp; implemented the vehicle physics to the car driven by the main character, and a truck used by the game's villains.

Eventually, Lua scripts were used to customize the physics settings for the different vehicles in the game.

The physics work involved a lot of trial and error, playing the vehicle game scenes over and over, tweaking the settings and getting it just right.
