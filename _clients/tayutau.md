# Tayutau

### Overview

The project was developed with Unity for iPhone and Android smartphones.

The game featured close-up shots of the character's faces, dynamically animated with a middlware plugin from Silicon Studio called [Motion Portrait](https://www.siliconstudio.co.jp/en/products-service/motion-portrait/){: target="_blank"}.

### Unity Plugin Development

#### MotionPortrait

I was in charge of implementing Motion Portrait as a Unity plugin for the game and supported both mobile platforms.

I built the necessary motion portrait binaries for iPhone and Android. It was not a straight forward process as custom changes to the Motion Portrait rendering code were needed to get it to work.

The iPhone side of the plugin was programmed with Objective C++. The Android side of the plugin was programmed with C++ and the Android NDK.
