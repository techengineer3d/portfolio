I have worked in the games industry for over 15 years as an Engineer and a Technical Artist with a focus on pipeline tools and graphics programming.

I like finding efficient ways to optimize work loads, reduce development time and solve the daily problems encountered on game development projects.

I am also very passionate about real-time 3D graphics and have a strong interest in Dev-Ops, AI and Machine Learning.

I studied game development programming at [DigiPen in Vancouver, British Columbia](https://www.digipen.edu/about/our-history){: target="_blank"}. 
Afterwards, I decided to move overseas to pursue a career as a game developer, continue my studies in game development and gain international experience abroad.

Recently I was working as an Engineer in the Advanced Technology Division at [Square Enix](/portfolio/clients/square-enix/){: target="_blank"}

Prior to that, I worked as a Technical Artist on the Playstation 4 title "[Project Awakening : Arise" at Cygames.](/portfolio/clients/cygames/){: target="_blank"}

I have also worked on console and mobile game titles including [Final Fantasy Grandmasters](/portfolio/clients/crooz/){: target="_blank"}, [Final Fantasy Agito](/portfolio/clients/tayutau/){: target="_blank"} and [Demon's Souls](/portfolio/clients/from-software/){: target="_blank"}.
